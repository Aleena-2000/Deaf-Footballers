PROJECT DETAILS

PROVIDING TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS FOR DIFFICULTIES FACED IN DEAF FOOTBALL.

ABSTRACT

The main premise of our idea is to incorporate technology in finding solutions for problems faced by deaf footballers. We intend to embed programmable LEDs in boots and goalposts, which the referee operates to indicate fouls, halftime and full time. Further, vibration bracelets for all players which turn on when a particular player needs to be substituted.


OBJECTIVES
•	Enabling deaf players to know when a fowl takes place.
•	Aiding deaf players in knowing they are at halftime or full time.
•	Allowing more flexibility in player substitution.


TECHNOLOGY USED
•	Internet of Things
•	Arduino IDE
•	Wi-Fi/Bluetooth


FUTURE UPSCALING
 
 PHASE 1
•	Research and Development with the help of IEDC for the expansion of the prototype as a finished product.
•	Collaboration with Kerala Start-up Mission for manufacturing said product on a larger scale.
•	Alliance with All India Sports Council for the Deaf (AISCD) for driving the product to the intended market audience.

PHASE 2
•	Procuring external funding from agencies or individuals interested in achieving our mission.
•	Research in whether the product/technology can be used in other sectors and its implementation.
•	Research in cost effective methods to include bleeding edge technology in said product, without compromising simplicity.
•	Examine the worldwide feasibility of the product and maximize profits earned.
